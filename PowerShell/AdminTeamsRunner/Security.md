### The code is generally secure and works to get admin rights to run a program via Teams.
### It creates a temporary batch file that contains the command to run the program with elevated privileges.
### This batch file is then executed by a new PowerShell process running with the specified administrative credentials.

## However, there are a few potential security considerations:

1. Storing Administrative Credentials in Plaintext: The code retrieves administrative credentials directly from the user without any encryption or protection. This makes the credentials potentially vulnerable to eavesdropping or theft. It is recommended to use a more secure method for providing administrative credentials, such as a pre-shared secret or a password manager.

2. Temporary Batch File: The code creates a temporary batch file in the C:\Windows\Temp directory. This file may contain sensitive information, such as the executable path and the administrative credentials. It is important to ensure that the file permissions are set appropriately to prevent unauthorized access.

3. Error Handling: The code handles errors by writing a message to the console. However, it does not provide any further information about the error or take any corrective action. It is recommended to handle errors more gracefully, such as logging the error to a file or providing more informative error messages to the user.
