Welcome to the Password Generator script by L4ndbo!
This PowerShell script is designed to generate secure and random passwords based on customizable criteria. 
Below, you'll find information about what the script can do, the current to-do list, and exciting possibilities for future implementations.


## Features

- Generates strong and random passwords.
- Customizable password length.
- Utilizes character sets including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Ensures that the generated password includes characters from all selected sets.


## Getting Started

To use the Password Generator script:

1. Open the script in a PowerShell environment.
2. Customize the `$Length` variable if you want a password of a different length.
3. Run the script to generate a new password.
4. The generated password will be displayed in the console and copied to the clipboard.


## Todo List

### Password Generator Script
- [ ] Refactor the script for better readability and maintainability.
- [ ] Add options for custom password length.
- [ ] Enhance the user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
- [ ] Test the script thoroughly to ensure secure and random password generation.
- [ ] Document usage instructions and options within the script.
- [ ] Consider adding an option to save generated passwords to a file.
- [ ] Encourage community feedback and contributions for further improvements.
